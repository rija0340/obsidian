It's difficult to say exactly what type of test a hiring company would require for a backend developer position using PHP, as the specifics of the test can vary depending on the company and the job requirements. However, here are some general topics that you might expect to be tested on:

1.  PHP programming: You can expect to be tested on your knowledge of PHP syntax and programming concepts, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and classes.
    
2.  Object-oriented programming: Many PHP applications are developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, so you can expect to be tested on your understanding of OOP concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
    
3.  Web development: Since you will be working on backend development for web applications, you can expect to be tested on your knowledge of web development concepts, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as server-side concepts, such as HTTP requests and responses.
    
4.  Database management: Backend developers often work with databases to store and retrieve data, so you can expect to be tested on your knowledge of database management concepts, such as SQL, data modeling, and database design.
    
5.  Problem-solving and critical thinking: You can expect to be given coding challenges or problems to solve during the test, to evaluate your problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
    

These are some of the topics that a hiring company might test you on, but the specifics of the test can vary widely depending on the company and the job requirements. It's a good idea to research the company and the job requirements to get a better idea of what to expect in the test.


In addition to the technical skills I mentioned earlier, the hiring company might also test you on your ability to understand and work with software requirements and specifications, as well as your ability to test and debug code. These skills are important for a backend developer, as they help ensure that the software being developed meets the requirements and functions as intended.

Here are some ways the company might test your skills in these areas:

1.  Software requirements: The hiring company might give you a set of requirements or specifications for a software application and ask you to develop a solution using PHP. They might also ask you to provide feedback or suggestions on the requirements, to evaluate your ability to think critically and provide constructive feedback.
    
2.  Testing and debugging: The company might give you a piece of code to debug or ask you to write unit tests for a piece of code, to evaluate your ability to identify and fix bugs in code.
    
3.  Communication skills: Conception and testing often involve working with other team members, such as project managers, designers, and quality assurance testers. The hiring company might evaluate your communication skills by asking you to explain your thought process, provide feedback, or collaborate with others on a coding challenge.
    

Overall, a hiring company might evaluate your technical skills, as well as your ability to work with software requirements and specifications, test and debug code, and communicate effectively with others.
