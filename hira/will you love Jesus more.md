I feel quite sure if I did my best  
I could maybe impress you  
With tender words and harmony  
A clever rhyme or two  
But if all I've done  
In the time we've shared  
Is turn your eyes on me  
Then I've failed at what  
I've been called to do  
There's someone else I want you to see

Will you love Jesus more  
When we go our different ways  
When this moment is a memory  
Will you remember His face  
Will you look back and realize  
You sensed His love  
More than you did before  
I pray for nothing less  
Than for you to love Jesus more

I'd like to keep these memories  
In frames of gold and silver  
And reminisce a year from now  
About the smiles we've shared  
But above all else I hope you will come  
To know the Father's love  
When you see the Lord face to face  
You will hear Him say "well done"

Will you love Jesus more  
When we go our different ways  
When this moment is a memory  
Will you remember His face  
Will you look back and realize  
You sensed His love  
More than you did before  
I pray for nothing less  
Than for you to love Jesus more

Will you love Jesus more  
When we go our different ways  
When this moment is a memory  
Will you remember His face  
Will you look back and realize  
You sensed His love  
More than you did before  
I pray for nothing less  
Than for you to love Jesus more

I pray for nothing less  
Than for you to love Jesus more
