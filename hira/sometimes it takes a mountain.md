SOMETIMES IT TAKES A MOUNTAIN 

I faced a mountain that I never faced before 
That’s why I’m calling on You, Lord 
And I know it’s been awhile 
But, Lord, please hear my prayer 
I need You like I never have before 

Sometimes it takes a mountain 
Sometimes a troubled sea 
Sometimes it takes a desert 
To get a hold of me 

Your love is so much stronger 
Than whatever troubles me 
Sometimes it takes a mountain 
To trust You and believe 

Forgive me, Jesus, I thought I could control whatever life would throw my way 
Oh, but this, I will admit, has brought me to my knees 
And I need You, Lord, and I’m not ashamed to say 

Sometimes it takes a mountain 
Sometimes a troubled sea 
Sometimes it takes a desert 
To get a hold of me 

Your love is so much stronger 
Than whatever troubles me 
Sometimes it takes a mountain 
To trust you and believe 

Sometimes it takes a mountain 
Sometimes a troubled sea 
Sometimes it takes a desert 
To get a hold of me 

Your love is so much stronger 
Than whatever troubles me 
Sometimes it takes a mountain 
To trust you and believe 

Sometimes it takes a mountain 
To trust you and believe 

Oh, Lord, I believe, I believe
