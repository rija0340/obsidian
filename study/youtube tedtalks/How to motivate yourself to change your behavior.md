1. Social incentives
2. Immediate reward
3. Progress monitoring
4. Fear induces inaction
5. The thrill of a gain induces action

it does not mean that we should not tell people the bad sides of theirs actions but, highlight the incentives instead, most of the time 
exemole  : if you stop smoking you will be better at sports 
not you will have desease

giving people the sense of control is really important for motivating them.
